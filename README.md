## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

KAIRO Software Company aims to develop an Internship Exploration Application that provides a unified platform for managing the entire internship lifecycle. The application will enable students to create digital profiles, explore and apply for opportunities that match their skills and preferences.

On the recruiter side, the system will allow companies to post internship openings, review candidate applications, manage shortlisting and interviews, and access analytics to evaluate trends in applications and selections.

The platform will focus on secure data handling, transparent communication, and efficient matching between students and recruiters.

This project will deliver a scalable and interactive solution that streamlines internship exploration, supports better decision-making for both students and recruiters, and enhances the overall internship experience.
